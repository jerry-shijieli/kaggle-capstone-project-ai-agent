This is a fascinating area because for a long time, there have been significant biological targets that have eluded effective therapeutic intervention. Let's dive deeper into why this is important and what's happening.\n\n**What does \"Undruggable\" mean?**\n\nHistorically, the term \"undruggable\" referred to targets (usually proteins) that were difficult to interact with using conventional small molecule drugs or antibodies. This difficulty stemmed from several factors:\n\n*   **Lack of a Clear Binding Pocket:** Many targets don't have well-defined pockets where a small molecule can bind tightly and exert its effect.\n*   **Shallow or Flat Surfaces:** If a target has a large, flat surface involved in its function, it's hard to design a drug that can specifically block that interaction without causing widespread unintended consequences.\n*   **Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs):** As mentioned before, these proteins lack a stable 3D structure. They are dynamic and flexible, making it incredibly challenging to design a drug that can bind to them in a specific way.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** Many critical cellular processes involve proteins interacting with each other. Disrupting these interactions is notoriously difficult because they often involve large, transient interfaces.\n\n**Why is Expanding the \"Undruggable\" Landscape So Important?**\n\nMany diseases are driven by biological processes that involve these \"undruggable\" targets. For example:\n\n*   **Cancer:** Many oncogenes (cancer-causing genes) involve proteins that interact in complex ways or are difficult to inhibit directly.\n*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's):** The aggregation and misfolding of certain proteins are hallmarks of these diseases, and these proteins can be challenging to target.\n*   **Viral Infections:** Viruses rely on intricate protein interactions for replication and spread.\n*   **Autoimmune Diseases:** Dysregulated protein interactions can fuel chronic inflammation.\n\nBy finding ways to drug these targets, we open up entirely new avenues for treating diseases that currently have limited or no effective therapies.\n\n**New Developments Making Progress:**\n\nThis is where cutting-edge science and technology, especially AI, are making a significant impact:\n\n1.  **Targeting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):**\n    *   **AI for Interface Prediction:** AI algorithms are being trained to predict the specific regions on proteins that are involved in interactions. This allows researchers to focus their drug design efforts on these critical \"hotspots.\"\n    *   **\"Druggable\" Hotspot Identification:** AI can analyze structural data and molecular dynamics to identify specific amino acids within the interaction interface that are most susceptible to being targeted by a drug.\n    *   **Novel Drug Modalities:** Beyond traditional small molecules, researchers are exploring:\n        *   **Molecular Glues:** These are small molecules that don't directly bind to the target but instead \"glue\" the target protein to another protein that the cell naturally degrades, effectively removing the target protein.\n        *   **Peptide Therapeutics:** Short chains of amino acids that can be designed to mimic natural interactions or block specific binding sites.\n        *   **PROTACs (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras):** These are bifunctional molecules that recruit a cellular degradation machinery (E3 ligase) to specifically target and degrade a protein of interest. This is a very powerful approach for \"undruggable\" targets.\n\n2.  **Addressing Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs):**\n    *   **AI for Understanding Dynamics:** AI is crucial for modeling and understanding the complex, dynamic nature of IDPs. By simulating their conformational changes, researchers can identify transient structures that might be amenable to drug binding.\n    *   **\"Allosteric\" Drug Design:** Instead of binding to the active site, drugs can be designed to bind to a different part of the protein (an allosteric site) and indirectly alter its function. This can be a strategy for IDPs.\n    *   **Targeting Protein Aggregation:** For diseases where IDPs aggregate (like amyloid formation in Alzheimer's), research is focused on preventing or reversing this aggregation.\n\n**Examples of Progress and Companies to Watch:**\n\n*   **Nurix Therapeutics:** Focuses on PROTACs and molecular glues for targeted protein degradation.\n*   **Arvinas:** A leader in developing PROTACs for various diseases.\n*   **Cerevel Therapeutics:** Investigating novel targets in the central nervous system, some of which were previously considered difficult to drug.\n*   **Generative AI in PPI Drug Design:** Companies are using generative AI to design peptides and small molecules that specifically disrupt PPIs.\n\nThe ability to effectively target \"undruggable\" proteins represents a significant leap forward in our capacity to combat a wide range of devastating diseases. It's a testament to the power of combining deep biological understanding with advanced computational tools.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of the \"expanding the 'undruggable' landscape\" in drug discovery.

The AI agent elaborated on what \"undruggable\" means, explaining that it refers to targets difficult to interact with using conventional drugs due to factors like lack of clear binding pockets, shallow surfaces, or the nature of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The AI emphasized the importance of targeting these \"undruggable\" entities for treating diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
